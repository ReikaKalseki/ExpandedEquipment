<Description>
	Adds new equipment to improve your survivability or comfort:
	- Night Vision Goggles, allowing for some level of vision in dark caves (lighting is still very useful, but now it is not totally blacked out in the dark)
	- Spring Boots, cushioning fall damage, including saving you from a fatal fall if you are at max health
	- Item Magnet, greatly increasing item collection range
